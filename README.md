# Genetic-Algorithm

There are two scenes here:

Coloured Survivour:

There are different coloured population and you click whatever colour you want to kill first under 10 seconds you click it so that the last killed colour can combine and generate the offsprings of same colour. In each generation 10 offsprings are spwaned randomly. Again, you click the wanted coloued person at last so that they can create the offsprings with same gene i.e colour. Also, due to mutation every 5/100 times, one offspring of different colour could be generated. Also, same thing can be done with size as we do with colour.


Ethan Survivor:

There are 50 Ethan bots who try to survive longest on a platform. They are allowed 6 options run walk straight, walk left, walk right, walk in the direction behind, jump, and crouch. Each of 50 randomly spawned Ethans inside a closed area are assigned random choice. The longest survivours will copulate and create offsprings with crossover algorithm. So, in next generation more offsprings are created from the fittest survivours. Also, mutation occurs 1/100 times and given random choice again for the mutated Ethan. The number of Ethans can be adjusted in the code.
